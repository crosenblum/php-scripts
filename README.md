php-scripts
===========

php-scripts is a collection of different small php projects/scripts, that I work on, because I am bored, and want something weird and interesting to work on.

One of my interests is to help manage and maintain my router more effectively. Since it is not the kind that can be updated to Tomato or DD-WRT. So these first scripts are just a way to grab the data via the web-based interface to the router.

Have fun.
